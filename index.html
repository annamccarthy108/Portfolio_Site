			1992 Barcelona Olympic Games poster recreation <br> graphic design class<br><br>project objectives: recreate a past Olympic Games poster, without using Olympics logo<br><br>
			Since we were instructed to not use any Olympic Games branding I chose to express the energy of the city through colors that reflect Barcelona (flag colors, and magnetic colors) with creative type play to show the bustling strength of the games, with a headline/article from a report on the event. </p>

poster for the visually impaired  <br>graphic design class<br><br>project objectives: create a 'how-to' poster for a viewer with a disability<br> <br>
This poster was designed specifically for visually impaired viewers. I researched guidelines on how to market towards this audience, and then designed based on my findings. I included contrasting colors, a bold typeface, and imagery so viewers can clearly understand how to use an escalator. This poster was then hung near escalators around Loyola University New Orleans. </p>

Postcard for The Arts Council of New Orleans<br> <br>
This postcard was sent to <b>over 1500 people</b> throughout New Orleans, encouraging recipients to attend the Arts Council's art vendor fair. The various pieces that are used in the card were actual pieces for sale that were at the art market. I abided the Arts Council's brand standards of typefaces and colors while still clearly communicating where and when the market will be. Over <b>2000 people attended</b> this market, so the postcard was successful.</p>

			National Student Advertising Competition - <b>Creative Director</b> <br> <br>
		As creative director I was responsible for producing our overall creative direction based on research of target markets. I then constructed these visions to come to life through designing, working with copywriters, and organizing team members. I created the creative concept, 'Brings You Back', based on research, formatted the plans book, and designed the mock ups for various ideas. </p>

		 'Brings You Back' was chosen due to an overwhelming amount of research showing us that consumers associated Ocean Spray with nostalgia. Nostalgia for our target audience, millennials, is the 1990s. I created brand standards for our campaign, including typefaces, colors, and elements that must be used. These brand standards were chosen from a mix of popular 1990s colors and typefaces, Pantone's colors of the year, and hand illustrated elements from the 1990s. All brand standards were chosen to be cohesive with our creative tactic, 'Brings You Back'.
